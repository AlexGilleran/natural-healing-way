According to conventional medicine, stress, anxiety, depression and fatigue are symptoms of abnormal brain chemistry. As such, doctors often prescribe a variety of pharmaceutical drugs that attempt to mimic a sense of normalcy, but instead leave you feeling empty, drained and emotionally hollow.

At Natural Healing we treat your stress, depression or fatigue not just as another chemical in your body, but rather in the whole context of your body’s holistic physical and emotional wellbeing. Our treatments involve an initial assessment of your individual situation, so that we can recommend the best treatment for you.

Our therapists have treated various cases of stress, fatigue and depression and recommend a treatment combination of Shiatsu massage, acupuncture, herbs and meridian alignment, depending on your circumstances.
