# FAQ

## Do you offer health fund rebates?

Yes we do! Natural Healing is an Australian based approved provider with all major health funds.

If you are a member of a health fund, you may be able to claim a rebate on your remedial massage and acupuncture treatment with us. How much you will be able to claim depends on your level of cover and whether you have recently claimed or not.

To find out more, please check with your health fund to see what your entitlements are.

## What does a typical visit involve?

If you are a first time client, we recommend a consultation with our therapist for a holistic assessment of your health and your body’s individual situation. The consultation will likely involve a pulse and tongue analysis and discussion of your day-to-day lifestyle choices. Based on the consultation, the therapist will recommend the most suitable treatment options for you.

## Is acupuncture painful?

We get this one all the time!

Although it sounds intimidating, acupuncture uses extremely fine needles which rarely produce pain when inserted. Patients have described the feeling of acupuncture as a mild tingling or an electric sensation. After acupuncture, there may be minor bruising or scattered red spots at the needle location – this will fade within 1-2 days. This is completely normal and a sign the acupuncture is doing its work.

After acupuncture, our patients generally report feeling deeply relaxed and almost weightless.

## Can your herbs and treatments be used in conjunction with conventional medicine?

Definitely! There are very few reports of adverse reactions between natural therapy/herbs and conventional medicine. In fact, it’s routine practice in China for the two to be used in conjunction as complementary treatments.

That said, it’s always important to inform your therapist of any medications you’re taking so he can assess potential risks and tailor treatments to your situation.

## How many treatments do I need before I'm better?

This is a difficult question to answer on many levels.

Your body and situation are unique and there’s no general formula that can guarantee the number of treatments you need before you’re better. Needless to say, the longer you’ve had a particular illness, the longer it will generally take to treat it.

Under general conditions, our patients will usually see a noticeable difference after 1-2 treatments and marked improvement after 4-5 consecutive treatments.
