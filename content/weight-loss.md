Controlling weight can be a slow and frustrating process. We are bombarded everyday with so many extreme fad diets, weight loss pills and conflicting information that we sometimes lose sight of the real reason we wanted to lose weight in the first place – our health.

Unlike many other weight loss programs, Natural Healing’s treatments aim to treat the underlying cause of excess weight whether it be overeating, system imbalances, water retention or a slow functioning metabolism. We help you lose weight (and keep it off) in a healthy and safe manner.

Natural Healing incorporates a variety of weight loss treatments including:

- **Detoxifying teas** – this contains a combination of teas and spices which have been used for centuries in Ancient China to support the internal cleansing process. Helps lose weight by eliminating excess fluids and toxins.
- **Abdominal massage** – this stimulates the abdominal area to improve digestion, absorption of food and help physically break up fats stored in the stomach. Also incorporates elements of lymphatic drainage massage to flush away toxins and prevents the formation of new fatty deposits.
- **Weight loss acupuncture** – this approaches weight loss from a lifestyle control point of view. It works by activating your endorphins and stimulating chi flow through particular pressure points to control overeating and cravings. Extended use of weight loss acupuncture is known to improve digestion, reduce stress, stimulate the metabolism and reduce cravings and appetite.
- **Herbs** – this approaches weight loss in a threefold manner: detox to prevent the accumulation of unhealthy fats and fluids; chi stimulation to promote a healthy digestion & metabolism and energy balance to reduce cravings and control appetite.
- **Tai Chi** – this can be used together with Natural Healing’s other treatments to help you lose weight by promoting peace and relaxation in conjunction with healthy exercise.
