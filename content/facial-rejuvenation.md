At Natural Healing, we believe that health and beauty are intrinsically connected. To enhance beauty, you must enhance health – a philosophy ignored by many modern cosmetic procedures, which promote short-term beauty at the expense of your long-term wellbeing.

Our facial rejuvenation treatments are holistic, non-invasive and completely safe. We use a combination of facial massage, cosmetic acupuncture and detoxifying herbs to balance your system and stimulate collagen and elastin production.

After several treatments your skin will look younger and firmer, with improved muscle tone and a healthy facial glow. Our treatments also have the added benefit of targeting underlying health conditions and relieving stress – leaving our patients feeling relaxed, refreshed and rejuvenated.

Our facial rejuvenation treatments help:

- improve muscle tone, firmness and elasticity of the skin
- eliminate fine lines and soften deeper wrinkles
- tightens pores and reduce sagging around the eyes and neck
- improve facial colour by increasing peripheral circulation
- stimulate collagen production and improve hormonal balance to reduce acne
- improve the appearance of scarring
- slow the ageing process from within
