# Male and Female Fertility

<img alt="Picture of a baby" src="/Infertility.jpg" className="float-right-image" />

Infertility can be one of the most difficult problems faced by a couple – there is nothing more frustrating and defeating than trying and failing, time and time again to conceive a child. What many couples do not realise in their efforts is that fertility is not an isolated issue, but rather a reflection of the body’s overall balance and wellbeing. To promote fertility, we must enhance health.

Natural Healing has a long and successful history of treating both male and female functional infertility. Our treatments can be used in isolation or as part of a wider treatment system in couples undergoing IVF.

We use a combination of treatments including acupuncture, herbs, meridian alignment and lifestyle therapy to increase blood and chi flow to reproductive organs, resulting in increased ovarian function in woman and increased sperm production in men.

Our treatments improve fertility and increase pregnancy rates by:

- regulating hormone levels to produce more follicles
- improving the function of the ovaries to produce better quality eggs
- enhancing the uterine lining by increasing blood flow to the uterous
- preventing uterus contractions and other causes of miscarriage
- in males, invigorating sperm and enhancing sperm count and mobility
- reducing the side effects of IVF drugs
- regulating stress levels
- strengthening the immune system
