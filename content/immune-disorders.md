# Immune Disorders

A weakened immune system can affect all areas of our life. The symptoms generally start harmlessly enough â€“ a few sniffles here or there, a persistent cough, a never-ending flu.

Before long however, we find ourselves exhausted and drained, gradually developing all manners of small and irritating illnesses. It is only then that we realise how truly weakened our immune system has become.

A weakened immune system can lead to a variety of severe immune disorders including:

- Allergies
- Asthma
- Autoimmune diseases
- Eczema
- Anaphylaxis
- Fibromyalgia
- Glandular fever
- Lupus

At Natural Healing, we treat immune disorders using a combination of herbs, acupuncture and meridian alignment, which aims to enhance your immune system by regulating hormones, reducing chi and blood stagnation and increasing the absorption of nutrients. Our treatments are extremely effective and are targeted not merely at short term relief, but long term recovery.
