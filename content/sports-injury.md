# Sports Injury

Sports injury is one of the most common areas of health concern. It encompasses a wide range of aches and injuries – from chronic pain experienced by athletes after years of physical strain, to those irritating one-off accidents.

Sports injuries commonly involve stress or damage to muscles, ligaments, tendons and joints – the areas we use the most in everyday life. As such, it can be highly disruptive to our daily patterns and can negatively impact our overall enjoyment of life.

At Natural Healing we use a combination of acupuncture and sports injury massage to reduce pain, increase your range of motions and dramatically increase healing time. Our treatments are specifically targeted at:

- decreasing inflammation
- reducing swelling
- relaxing muscles and relieve spasms
- decreasing bruising
- lowering the body’s pain response
- improving local blood circulation to increase delivery of nutrients and removal of noxious elements

Our treatments are completely natural and aim to stimulate particular pressure points to increase chi flow and speed up your body’s intrinsic healing mechanisms. Our methods are especially effective in treating common injuries such as:

- muscle pain
- neck, shoulder, lower back and knee injuries
- tennis elbow
- pitcher’s shoulder
- golfer’s elbow
- trick knee
- ankle sprain
- tendonitis
- shin splints
- trigger finger
